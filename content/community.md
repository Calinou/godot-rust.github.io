# GDNative in general

For questions about using `godot-rust` the `#gdnative` channel on the [Godot Engine community Discord server](https://godotengine.org/community) can be used.

For IRC users, the `#godotengine-gdnative` channel on freenode can be used, and is bridged with the aforementioned Discord channel.

# `godot-rust` specific

Primary communication between developers of the project happens on the [`godot-rust` Discord server](https://discord.gg/FNudpBD). Developers looking to contribute are encouraged to join this server to discuss changes with maintainers and other contributors.

Users may also consider using this server if the general channels aren't sufficient, or if there is need to contact a maintainer specifically.

If those platforms are not accessible enough for you, please let us know and we can look into opening new channels, and possibly bridging them if needed.
